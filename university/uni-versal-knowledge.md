“…there are **known knowns**; there are things we know we know. We also know there are **known unknowns**; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also **unknown unknowns** — the ones we don’t know we don’t know.”

– **Donald Rumsfeld**, United States Secretary of Defense

# Marvel of Annotation Processing in Android

## Pitch
Writing code is cool, but see it generating automatically is even cooler! This talk will be a case study about possibilities of Annotation Preprocessing in Java development and when you would actually use it. Let's look into popular libraries and frameworks that are using Annotation Preprocessing, talk about it pros and cons compared with Reflection / Runtime Code Generation and when you would actually need compile time code generation in favour of generating bytecode at Runtime. Also during this talk we will glance into two most popular compile time code generation libraries - Dagger 2.0 and Lombok, and discuss their effectiveness

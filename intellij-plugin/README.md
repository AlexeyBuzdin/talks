# Writing a Plugin for IntelliJ Idea or Android Studio

## Pitch

Do you wish you could click autocomplete an exotic language or drill down into framework String parameters? But sadly there's no IDE plugin for that, what a shame.. But do not fear, we have a solution! Let's explore how we could make our own plugin for our favourite tool. We will start with capability overview of plugin API, get into parsers and lexers, syntax highlight, adding buttons to toolbars, etc. As well as briefly cover best practices, build system configurations and deployment to get your plugin into the wilds into the plugin store!

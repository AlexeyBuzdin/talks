# Deep Dive into Cucumber-JVM

## Pitch

Cucumber is a good tool to write a BDD style DSL for your business tests to make them more transparent and readable for QA and Business Analyst alike. Cucumber itself has different engine realisations in JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C# and PHP each behaving and having slightly different set of features. In this talk we will try to deep dive into Cucumber-JVM version, what features it provides, how to structure and parallelise tests to run them from Build Tool, how to properly integrate it with CI, what is the Lifecycle of Cucumber-JVM Engine, how to use a DI tool in Cukes, how does Plugin system works and how you can hack it apart to get the most out of it.
